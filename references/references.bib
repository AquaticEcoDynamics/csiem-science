abstract = {{Our study aimed at elucidating the role of internal loading in the budget of phosphorus (P) and assessed the importance of resuspension and diffusive fluxes for P cycling in large, shallow Lake Peipsi. The internal loading of P was quantified by a mass balance approach that considered the gross sedimentation of P as a component. The gross sedimentation of P was measured with sediment traps during May–October 2011. Additionally, we followed the monthly dynamics of diffusive fluxes and resuspension of P within this time period. The gross sedimentation of P dominated the mass balance calculations in Lake Peipsi. The resuspension of P constituted 62–68\% of the gross sedimentation of P, and thereby accounted for the bulk of the total internal P load. Until late July, the release of P by diffusion was similar in magnitude to that of resuspension. Since August, resuspension was of governing importance for P cycling: the release of P by resuspension at that time was about 40-fold higher than that of the diffusion. Therefore, diffusion and resuspension provided a continuous supply of P to the water column during the growing season.}},

Resuspension was created in in situ incubation chambers to study the possible resuspension effect on the fluxes of nutrients, oxygen and total carbonate. In most cases, resuspension changed the flux rates. The fluxes of oxygen, total carbonate and phosphate decreased during the resuspension event. The oxygen fluxes before resuspension were between 15 and 23 mmol m−2 day−1 in the four chambers, and decreased during resuspension to between 8 and 18 mmol m−2 day−1. The fluxes of total carbonate in the chambers before resuspension were 12–35 mmol m−2 day−1 and decreased to 4–15 mmol m−2 day−1. The change for each flux during resuspension was statistically significant. The fluxes of nitrate–nitrite and silicic acid increased, whereas the fluxes of ammonium did not change significantly. Hydrodynamic and meteorological data showed that the natural created resuspension at the study site were not due to wind-induced waves, but to strong bottom currents that can be caused when water built-up against land during strong wind events. When the wind abates, the water is flushing back and creates strong currents high enough to cause resuspension of the bottom sediments. A major storm passing the area during the experimental period caused particulate material to suspend to a concentration of about 11 mg/l in the bottom water, which was similar to the suspended material concentration in one set of the incubation chambers.}},

abstract = {{Simulation models were used to predict the concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), ammonium and nitrate in sediment pore waters, under various conditions. The quantity of particulate organic matter (POM) undergoing decomposition varied from 5–85 mmol C m−2 d−1; this POM had C:N ratios of 5 or 10, and was distributed in three different ways. The POM was either located close to the sediment surface, or decreased linearly from the surface, or was completely mixed into the sediment. The effect of resuspending the sediment to various depths, for this suite of profiles, was determined. The different distributions gave unique patterns, but it was concluded that sediment must be resuspended to considerable depth before any major contribution was made to the overlying water. Thus, at the highest POM degradation rate, in order to get a liberation of ΣN of 5 mmol m−2, it was necessary to resuspend the top, linear and mixed distributions to depths of 2.4, 1.2 and 0.8 cm respectively. The model predicted that after mixing of the latter to 2.4 cm, profiles of ammonium and other molecules had returned to pre-mixing values after ∼ 5 h. It was predicted that resuspension would not increase the quantity of nitrogen molecules exported to the overlying water, but it would affect the timing.}},

In this study, the role of turbulence structure on sediment resuspension was examined at Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China. The instantaneous three-dimensional velocity and suspended sediment concentrations were synchronously recorded by Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) and Optical Backscatter Sensor (OBS) placed close to the lakebed. Statistical and quadrant analyses results revealed that the coherent structure contributed significantly to sediment particle entrainment. The intermittent burst events (dominant ejection and sweep) were the main energy source for sediment resuspension processes. 99.2\% of turbulent sediment fluxes were triggered by ejection and sweep events, whereas the contributions coming from the outward interactions and inward interactions were relatively small. The large-amplitude burst events in the coherent structure dominated the influence on the sediment diffusion. Additionally, it was found that instantaneous sediment particle entrainment occurred earlier than the mean critical shear stress, which was induced by the stochastic nature of turbulence. The amount of sediment flux considering the turbulence characteristics was one or two larger magnitudes than the flux amount assessed by the time-averaged flow field, which indicated the critical shear stress approach might underestimate the sediment resuspension. Therefore, the influence of turbulence performance on sediment entrainment shall be seriously considered when evaluating sediment flux and internal nutrient loads in Lake Taihu.}},

The rates of deposition of resuspended material vary greatly with measurements recorded between 0.5 and 50 g m−2 d−1. In many systems and at many times of year resuspended material comprises the majority of the flux of particles to lake bottoms.

The abundance and community structure of cyanobacteria and pico-eukaryotes were investigated along a natural continuous salinity gradient (1.8\% to 15.5\%) using flow cytometry. Highest picophytoplankton abundances were recorded under salinity conditions ranging between 8.0\% and 11.0\% (1.3 × 106 to 1.4 × 106 cells ml-1). Two populations of picocyanobacteria (likely Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus) and 5 distinct populations of pico-eukaryotes were identified along the salinity gradient. The picophytoplankton cytometric-richness decreased with salinity and the most cytometrically diversified community (4 to 7 populations) was observed in the brackish-marine part of the lagoon (i.e. salinity below 3.5\%). One population of pico-eukaryote dominated the community throughout the salinity gradient and was responsible for the bloom observed between 8.0\% and 11.0\%. Finally only this halotolerant population and Prochlorococcus-like picocyanobacteria were identified in hypersaline waters (i.e. above 14.0\%).

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests macroalgal blooms may play a role in the worldwide decline in seagrass, but the shape of the functional relationship between seagrass health and dominant bloom-forming macroalgae is poorly characterized. We tested whether the impact of varying abundances of two cosmopolitan bloom-forming macroalgal genera caused linear/quasi-linear or sudden threshold changes in measures of eelgrass, Zostera marina, meadow health. We conducted two caging experiments in a shallow Z. marina bed (∼1 m depth) in Bodega Harbor, California, USA where we maintained six densities within the range of natural abundances of macroalgae, Ulva (0–4.0 kg m−2) and Gracilariopsis (0–2.0 kg m−2), as well as uncaged controls over a 10-week period. Shoot density, blade growth, and epiphyte load were measured every two weeks and algal treatments reset. We did not find support for threshold transitions between algal abundance and measures of seagrass bed health using sigmoidal and broken-stick regression analyses for each data set; these models are commonly used to identify threshold patterns in ecological shifts. Instead, final measurements of shoot density and epiphyte load were best modelled as linear or slightly non-linear declines with increasing Ulva abundance. A negative linear relationship also existed between shoot density and Gracilariopsis abundance and a trend towards linear negative effects on epiphyte load. The similar shape of these functional relationships across different types of algae suggests the relationship may be generalizable. At algal abundances that are commonly observed, we found smooth and predictable negative impacts to Z. marina by decline in shoot density and potential impacts to food webs by loss of epiphytes rather than sudden threshold shifts or “ecological surprises”. Our work contrasts with the growing body of literature suggesting highly non-linear shifts in response to human impact; thus, it is important to broaden understanding of shifts to more than just pattern but to the processes that drive different patterns of shifts.}

ABSTRACT={Freshwater flows to estuaries shape habitat, transport nutrients to drive productivity, and generate a salinity gradient that impacts water quality and provides spawning cues for fish. The aim of this study was to quantify how environmental flows improved outcomes for a coastal lagoon system (the Coorong, South Australia), considering the export, and prevention of ingress, of salt from the system, and the increased available habitat for key fish biota. A hydrodynamic model was used to simulate salinity and water temperature, and to determine the salt exchange between the Coorong and ocean for the observed conditions with environmental water release included. Scenario simulations showed that maintaining river flow is shown to arrest salt intrusion from the ocean into the Coorong. Without environmental water, the net import of salt into the Coorong would have been considerably greater, ranging between 1.86 million tonnes in 2018–19 to approximately 2.33 million tonnes in 2019–20. The fresher conditions created by environmental water provision supported a considerable expansion of suitable fish habitat area, derived from a simple habitat index based on salinity and water temperature. Without environmental water the habitat suitable for mulloway would have contracted by 38% over the 3 year investigation period. A similar trend is evident for black bream, Tamar goby, greenback flounder, yelloweye mullet, congolli and smallmouth hardyhead. The results highlighted the importance of cumulative benefits from delivering environmental water over multiple years, with different results obtained if the environmental water provided regularly or just focused over a single year. The approach used in this work to relate hydrological changes from water management to indicators of habitat suitability through changes to physical attributes provides information to inform the evaluation of environmental watering, as well as a tool to support future decision making to maximise the benefits from this precious resource.}

abstract = {{This study examines the influence of salinity on the germination of Ruppia tuberosa J. Davis and Tomlinson (seeds and turions) and seeds of Ruppia megacarpa R. Mason. This information is used to demonstrate how freshwater riverine inputs maybe used to restore the probability of germination of Ruppia sp. in a major RAMSAR site, a coastal lagoon in South Australia (The Coorong) where salinity increases have been implicated as the major cause of the decline of Ruppia sp. a major food source for local and migratory water birds. Increased salinity led to a decrease in germination rates for R. tuberosa and R. megacarpa. The salinity thresholds for germination were 85–90g/L for R. tuberosa seeds, 120g/L for R. tuberosa turions and 30g/L for R. megacarpa seeds. An increase in salinity also led to an increase in mean time to germination of 15 days for R. tuberosa seeds (at 85g/L), 24 days for R. tuberosa turions (at 120g/L) and 10 days for R. megacarpa seeds (at 30g/L). Seeds of R. tuberosa that failed to germinate at elevated salinities germinated on transfer to low salinities at an enhanced rate compared with the initial rates. Turions of R. tuberosa did not respond in a similar manner because of ion toxicity after exposure to high salinities. This study suggests that salinity affects imbibition, inducing ion toxicities on seeds and turions, and consequently influences the germination process. Using recent elevated salinity levels of 40 to over 120g/L in the Coorong, modelling suggests that seed germination of R. tuberosa is likely to be restricted to the less saline northern half of the Coorong, but R. megacarpa germination is unlikely to occur. The modelling also suggests that riverine inputs that reduce salinity levels would restore R. tuberosa and R. megacarpa communities in the water-bodies where they were once abundant, but have declined in response to human induced salinisation.}},

abstract = {{Questions: Can a statistical model be designed to represent more directly the nature of organismal response to multiple interacting factors? Can multiplicative kernel smoothers be used for this purpose? What advantages does this approach have over more traditional habitat modelling methods? Methods: Non-parametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) was developed from the premises that: the response variable has a minimum of zero and a physiologically-determined maximum, species respond simultaneously to multiple ecological factors, the response to any one factor is conditioned by the values of other factors, and that if any of the factors is intolerable then the response is zero. Key features of NPMR are interactive effects of predictors, no need to specify an overall model form in advance, and built-in controls on overfitting. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with simulated and real data sets. Results: Empirical and theoretical relationships of species response to multiple interacting predictors can be represented effectively by multiplicative kernel smoothers. NPMR allows us to abandon simplistic assumptions about overall model form, while embracing the ecological truism that habitat factors interact.}},

abstract = {{This paper is the second in a series reporting a study of the genus Ruppia in South Australia. Two of the species of Ruppia found in South Australia, R. polycarpa Mason and R. tuberosa Davis and Tomlinson are found primarily in temporary salt lakes and exhibit annual life cycles. A third species, R. megacarpa Mason is perennial and is found only in permanent waters. The differences in the life cycles and reproductive biology of these species are considered in this paper.The standing crop of the annual species was always considerably less than that of the perennial: in Littl Dip Lake R. megacarpa communities had 410 g m−2 DW (grams per square metre dry weight) of total plant matter (282 g m−2 DW of R. megacarpa) in November 1977 whereas the annual population of the R. tuberosa) community had a standing crop of 11.7 g m−2 DW (3.3 g m−2 DW of R. tuberosa). Although these values varied with season and the salinity, depth and permanence of habitats, the difference between annuals and perennials held. Standing crop and time of seasonal maximum and minimum values showed further differences between annual and perennial life cycles: in Little Dip Lake ranges were 103 (September)-383 (November) g m−2 DW for R. megacarpa and 1.6 (June)-99.0 (September) g m−2 DW for R. tuberosa. R. polycarpa ranged from 4.2 (June) to 60.0 (September) g m−2 DW in a comparable habitat, Blue-Green Algal Pool.Partitioning of Ruppia into plant parts reveals differences between annual and perennial forms as well as seasonal differences within each life cycle. In the perennial, reproductive parts (flowers and seeds) always comprise only a small part of the total dry weight, whereas in the two annual species the proportion of reproductive parts (flowers, seeds and turions) is higher in all seasons. Even when vegetative growth of annuals is at its maximum the percentage of dry weight accounted for by reproductive parts is higher than at any stage in the life cycle of the perennial. Both seeds and asexual turions play a major role in propagating the annual species. The perennial spreads mainly by rhizomes.Turions are produced by both R. polycarpa and R. tuberosa in Australia. Two structural types of turions were found on R. tuberosa and only one of these on R. polycarpa. The anatomy and role of these organs in propagation are considered.}},

abstract = {{The effect of different temperatures (14, 20 and 30°C) and photoperiods (10 and 16 h) on the photosynthesis, growth and reproduction of Ruppia drepanensis Tineo plants from the Doñana National Park (SW Spain) were studied. After 84–91 days of growth under a 16 h photoperiod, the plants showed maximal biomass yield at 20°C (395 mg ash-free dry weight per plant), with lower yields at 14 and 30°C (216 and 284 mg ash-free dry weight per plant respectively). A short photoperiod resulted in a lower biomass yield when combined with low temperatures (59 mg afdw per plant, at 10 h and 14°C). Reproduction was also optimal at 20°C, while low temperatures (14°C) inhibited flower induction. No seed was produced at 30°C. Photoperiod had little effect on flowering, as compared with temperature. According to the photosynthetic performance of R. drepanensis, we can define this species as cold-adapted but also capable of acclimating to higher temperatures (30°C). Net photosynthesis at 250 μmol photons m−2 s−1 (P250) was maximal at 20°C (72 to 82 μg O2 g−1 afdw min−1). Photosynthetic plasticity allowed for high net production rates at 10°C (P250=65 to 68 μg O2 g−1 afdw min−1), independently of the temperature experienced during growth. At 30°C, however, net photosynthetic rates were lower in plants grown at 20°C than at 30°C (P250=6.5 and 55.9 μg O2 g−1 afdw min−1 respectively). The cold-adapted character of this Mediterranean endemism is finely tuned to the requirements of its winter–annual life cycle, while its acclimation capacity is suited to cope with the rapidly increasing temperatures along late spring in the temporary wetlands it inhabits.}},
