# Model-Data Organisation

<br>

The data requirements for the modelling are diverse and varied, spanning hydrological, meteorological, water and sediment quality (long-term monitoring, data from intensive campaigns and in situ sondes), plus ecological survey data. This creates an integration challenge for model setup, parameterisation and assessment (calibration and validation) (Figure \@ref(fig:csiem-pic5)).

```{r csiem-pic5, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', class = "text-image",fig.align='center', fig.cap = "The model-data ecosystem and conceptual approach to model-data integration, accomodating data diversity and varied model requirements."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/cdm/2_picture2.png")
```

To enable the ongoing use and development of the CSIEM in this context, we have developed a **model-data integration framework** able to be used by stakeholders to co-ordinate the reference datasets needed for model development, and standardise the data integration and modelling workflows. The below sections describe how the CSIEM is organised, the tools and approaches used for model provenance and managing data streams, and model versioning.
<br>

## CSIEM repository structure and organisation

The CSIEM repository ecosystem has been designed is such a way to both facilitate the sharing of data and models across various agencies and researchers, as well as providing a formalised structure to store, catalogue and process complex and unique datasets. Comparmentalised data structures have been implemented to allow for tracking and version control of data and models as they are utilised and upgraded throughout the project. Given the complexitites and scope of the requirements, four interconnected repositories have been created to house and share the accumulated project outputs:

- **csiem-science:** a repository for documenting the CSIEM workflows, model-data structure and integration, and results (the current CSIEM bookdown online manual);
- **csiem-data:** a platform for storing and sharing environmental data for this project;
- **csiem-model:** a platform for storing and sharing model files and configurations;
- **csiem-marvl:** a collection of scripts for visualising, assessing and reporting the data and model performance.

Github has been chosen to house the repository based on it's mature version control systems and cross platform program support to aid all stakeholders accessing the data and models (https://github.com/). In addition, there is a [wide variety of documentation online](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to assist users new to GitHub. Information on how to clone a publicly available GitHub repository can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository).

Data cataloguing via the "CSIEM Data Catalogue" (described in Section 3.3) has been designed with cross-agency usage in mind. Integration with the WAMSI Theme 10 Data Catalogue is essential to allow for the tracking of data changes and upgrades throughout the project, and to be used for modelling purposes. The "Point of Truth", "WAMSI Catalogue Classification" and "Status Notes" categories have been included in the CSIEM Data Catalogue to track a dataset's evolution throughout the project.

### **Online repository access**

The data and model files are stored in the Github [CSIEM Repository](https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/CSIEM) and shared with WAMSI research partners and end-users.

### **High level model-data integration workflows**

The raw data collected from previous works and current WAMSI research project outcomes are stored in the `csiem-data` folder and classified by their sources. These raw data are then post-processed using standard scripts to convert the raw data into ‘standardised’ data formatd (stored in the `data-warehouse` folder) that can be used for model configuration and boundary/initial conditions (stored in the `csiem-model` folder), and for model/data visualization, model calibration/validation, and reporting using the `csiem-marvl` analysis library. The data-model workflow is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:csiem-pic8).

```{r csiem-pic8, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', class = "text-image",fig.align='center', fig.cap = "CSIEM conceptual diagram showing the flow of data through the system"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/cdm/Workflow.png")

```

## Data repository and management

The details of data collection, processing, and catagorizing have been described in Chapter 3.3 and Appendix A. This section introduces the data repository and management related to the data-model integration framework.

### **Data repository folder structure**

The data repository folder structure follows the logic of data types and resources as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:csiem-pic7).

```{r csiem-pic7, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', class = "text-image",fig.align='center', fig.cap = "CSIEM Data online storage folder structure"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/cdm/csiem_data_folder_structure.png")

```

The root directories are listed and described below:

```{r A-folders, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(readxl)
library(rmarkdown)
theSheet <- read_excel('tables/folders.xlsx', sheet = 1)
theSheet <- theSheet[theSheet$Table == "data",]
theSheetGroups <- unique(theSheet$Group)

kbl(theSheet[,2:3], caption = "CSIEM Root Folder Descriptions", align = "l",) %>%

row_spec(0, background = "#14759e", bold = TRUE, color = "white") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = T,font_size = 10) %>%
    scroll_box(fixed_thead = FALSE)
```

### **Data catalogue**

All data that is uploaded to the CSIEM github repository is logged in the `csiem-data` CSIEM Data Catalogue. The catalogue (found in the data-governance directory) is comprised of a main data sheet ("CSIEM Data Catalogue") as well as summary sheets for all processed data. Every raw datafile is logged with the following information:

```{r A-metadata, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(readxl)
library(rmarkdown)
theSheet <- read_excel('tables/CSIEM_Classes.xlsx', sheet = 1)
theSheet <- theSheet[theSheet$Table == "Data",]
theSheetGroups <- unique(theSheet$Group)

kbl(theSheet[,3:4], caption = "CSIEM Catalogue Metadata", align = "l",) %>%

row_spec(0, background = "#002B4D", bold = TRUE, color = "white") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = T,font_size = 10) %>%
    scroll_box(fixed_thead = FALSE)
```

<br>

A catalogue of all relevant data under management is provided in [Appendix A](Appendix A : Data Catalogue).

<br>
<!--
Once imported, the data is then summerised via a script in the ```scripts/dataimport/summary``` directory to create a standard set of plots and summary tables that can be found in the ```data/summary``` directory. ESRI shapefiles are also automatically produced and saved into the ```gis/summary``` directory to be used to create a stardarised site map of the data's sampling locations.

```{r csiem-pic10, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', class = "text-image",fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Example GIS Map showing the sampling locations for the Water Data SA online data "}

knitr::include_graphics("images/cdm/DEW WaterDataSA Locations.png")
```

-->

### **ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) workflows**

All of the ETL pipeline scripts for the CSIEM Environmental Information Management are all contained within the `code/` directory, which has three subfolders:

- `import`: All scripts that process the raw data from the data-lake into the data-warehouse.
- `actions`: GitHub action functions, and well as secondary functions to control with pipeline is executed automatically.
- `functions`: Shared function that scripts within the above directories may call.

Scripting has been predominately carried out utilising the [Matlab](https://au.mathworks.com/?s_tid=gn_logo) programming language, however there are scripts within the `scripts` directory using both [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and [Python](https://www.python.org/). Users are able to add scripts in their preferred language; the repository core scripts for data storage and model plotting are currently in Matlab.

Below is an example workflow outlining how a meteorological boundary condition file for the TUFLOW-FV model is created (Figure \@ref(fig:csiem-pic9). Data is first downloaded and processed by scripts in the `code` directory. Standardised data is then stored in the `data-warehouse` for usage in the creation of model boundary input file and in the MARVL visualisation and analytics package.

```{r csiem-pic9, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', class = "text-image",fig.align='center', fig.cap = "CSIEM work flow diagram for met data"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/cdm/Met_Workflow.png")

```

## Model repository and management

### **Simulation naming and organization**

All model files are stored in the `csiem-model` repository. As the model is developed over time, the model files are classified with project names and model generation identifiers. The naming of model folders follows the convention of {Agency Code}_{Program Code}_{Model Code}_{Model Version}_{Model Period}.

The ‘WC’ folder contains the model files used for assessing PSDP by the Water Corporation; the ‘Westport’ folder contains the model files developed for assessing Westport Phase 1 scenarios, and the ‘WWSMP’ folder contains the the core CSIEM files being updated throughout the WAMSI Westport integration project.

Models within each project directory are separated via both _generation_ and model _type_. Within the WWSMP model folder there are currently 4 distinct models:

- `wwmsp_swan_v1`
- `wwmsp_tfvaed_Gen1.0_1PFT`
- `wwmsp_tfvaed_Gen1.5_4PFT_MAG`
- `wwmsp-rapid`

The `wwmsp_swan_v1` is the first generation of the Cockburn SWAN Wave model that has been developed (see Section 3.2). Found inside the `wwmsp_swan_v1` directory are two zipped model folders:

- `Coorong_swn_20170101_20220101_UA_Wind_200g_2000w.zip`
- `Coorong_swn_20191101_20220101_UA_Wind_200g_2000w.zip`

The `wwmsp-rapid` simulation folder and the `wwmsp_tfvaed_Gen1.0_1PFT` simulation folder both contain TUFLOW-FV - AED simulations, but are kept separate as they constitute different generations, using different grids, simulation periods and BC files. The Generation 1.5 simulation (`wwmsp_tfvaed_Gen1.5_4PFT_MAG`) represents an upgrade in the number of phytoplankton groups, new material zones and the addition of seagrass.

Each model folder may contain multiple simulation sets, but they will all rely on the same model base configuration, with minor differences or adujstments. Major changes to a model's configuration will constitute a change in generation numeber and these are stored in a separate folder. Note, models uploaded to the CSIEM repository may have been created by different agencies and researchers and should maintain a consistent naming convention.

### **TUFLOW-FV model organisation**

The TUFLOW-FV model found in the WWMSP project folder was created prior to the above structure being implemented and contains the following folder structure:

- `BCs`: boundary condition files, including tide and inflow boundary files; meteorological boundary files, and initial condition files;
- `External`: AED model files linked with the TUFLOW-FV, and optionally the ‘GOTM’ vertical mixing model if the CSIEM is in 3D mode;
- `Geo`: TUFLOW-FV model structure files, including geometry and mesh files, and GIS files controlling the nodestrings and material zones;
- `Input`: model control/configuration files;
- `Plotting` : Directory to store model output images;

The `wwmsp_tfvaed_Gen1.5_4PFT_MAG` simulation folder also contains a `bin` directory containing the windows binaries for the TFV-AED model

- `TFV:` Build version: 2020.03.105
- `AED:` Build version: 2.0.5b

### **SWAN Wave Model organisation**

The SWAN wave models found in the model directory have the following format:

- `01_geometry` : Contains the bathymetry input files as well as a automatically generated image of the bathymetry and a matlab .mat file containing the bathymetry information;
- `02_bc_dbase` : Contains the processed wind input files
- `03_simulation` : Contains the INPUT control file required to run the simulation
- `04_results` : Model output directory

The script required to create and configure a new SWAN wave model can be found in the `scripts/datatools/wave` directory.

## Model Assessment, Reporting and Visualisation Toolbox Repository

The publicly available GitHub repository called [`csiem-marvl`](https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/csiem-marvl) contains a wide variety of matlab scripts and functions that are used to process and visualise model output. Scripts that have been specifically developed for this project are contained within the `csiem-marvl` repository. Plotting and model processing types include:

- Time-series plotting;
- Transect plotting;
- Model animation creation;
- Error assessment;
- Wave model plotting;
- Habitat mapping (e.g., Ruppia & Fish HSI processing and mapping)
- Scenario comparison and "DelMap" plotting;
- Nutrient budget assessments.

In particular, `AEDmarvl_plot_timeseries` and `AEDmarvl_plot_transect` are the main functions that are frequently used. The `AEDmarvl_plot_timeseries` function uses data and gis files stored in the csiem-marvl repository, in addition to model output to create timeseries plots of the model (averaged within a polygon region) compared against field data. The plotting function will also automatically calculate a range of error statistics based on model output and field measured data.

```{r csiem-plottfvpolygon, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', class = "text-image",fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Example output from plottfv_polygon with error matrix"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/cdm/0005_CS_South.png")

```

`AEDmarvl_plot_transect` can also be found in the `csiem-marvl` repository. This plots model data extracted along a transect line during a specified plotting period, and compares against the range of field data found within that period.

```{r csiem-plottfvtransect, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', class = "text-image",fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Example output from plottfv_transect with distance from Goolwa Barrage (km) along the x-axis"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/cdm/2021-09-01_2022-01-01_Surface.png")

```

The `csiem-marvl` analysis library also houses scripts and functions for:

- Nutrient Budgeting;
- Stacked Area Transect;
- Curtain plotting;
- Mesh manipulation tools;
- Data exports;
- Sheet plotting and animation tools;

Some of the example plots from previous research projects using the marvl-similar scripts are shown below illustrating their capability and presentations. The `csiem-marvl` analysis library is currently under development to meet the needs with more data collection and modelling progress, such as sediment profiling and habitat index.

```{r csiem-stackedarea, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', class = "text-image",fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Example output from plottfv_transect_StackedArea with distance along the x-axis"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/cdm/stackedarea.png")

```

```{r csiem-nutrientbudget, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', class = "text-image",fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Example Nutrient Budgeting output of a polygon region."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/cdm/nutrient_budget_1.png")

```

## SEAF Prototype

The **S**hared **E**nvironmental **A**nalytics **F**acility is an cloud-based, multi-zonal analytics prototype being developed to support the Cockburn Sound environmental impact assessment process by WAMSI, in partnership with Microsoft, PwC Australia, Sentient Hubs and the Pawsey Supercomputer Research Centre. At the core of the prototype is the development of an open, standardised platform to support modelling and data services between diverse agencies and companies, on a secure robust platform. Built on Microsoft's Azure platform, and utilising the modelling expertise of Sentient Hub's, the SEAF prototype is being designed to facilitate complex modelling projects whilst maintainig a high degree of data security, transparancy and repeatability.

Based around Microsoft's **Analytics Landing Zone**, which can be described as a _Analytics Platform in a Box_, a single zone allows for an agency to carry out highly complex workflows, whilst maintaining an very high degree of security and tranparency. Metadata logging at each phase of a project allows for the reproducability of results, and the standardisation inherent in each ALZ means results can be repoduced outside of a single agencies ALZ. Data is shared between zones via automated processes currently under development by Microsoft, which will facilitate the creation of dynamic assessments between different agencies without comprimising data security.

```{r csiem-seaf, echo = FALSE, out.width='100%', class = "text-image",fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Data flow through a single Analytics Landing Zone"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/cdm/seaf.jpg")

```

The CSIEM Environmental Information Management system has been design to integrate seamlessly with the SEAF prototype once it has become operational. The data governance documentation has been designed to be easily transformed to work with Microsoft Purvue, and the base format of the data inside the data-warehouse also allows for quick ingestion into Azure Synapse and the header information into MS Purvue.

Both the SEAF Prototype and CSIEM EIM use GitHub as their main repository for configuration information and data in the case of CSIEM, and the user credentials used in one system will be available for use in the other.
